            <h3>Personal Life</h3>

            <p>Jobs had a complicated relationship with his biological family. He was given up for adoption by his birth mother, Joanne Schieble, and later reconnected with her after his adoptive mother's death. Jobs learned about his sister, Mona, during this reunion. He also discovered his Syrian roots but showed little interest in meeting his biological father, Abdulfattah Jandali.</p>

            <p>Jobs met his future wife, Laurene Powell, in 1989 during a lecture at Stanford Graduate School of Business. They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at Yosemite National Park. They had three children: Reed, Erin, and Eve. Despite being a billionaire, Jobs decided to limit his children's access to social media, computer games, and the internet.</p>

            <p>Jobs' stance on philanthropy remains mysterious. Despite being a wealthy and powerful figure, he kept his charitable actions private. He formed the Steven P. Jobs Foundation after leaving Apple, focusing on nutrition and vegetarianism. However, the foundation was closed when he launched NeXT. Upon his return to Apple in 1997, Jobs eliminated all philanthropic programs, and Apple was criticized as one of "America's least philanthropic companies." Jobs declined to sign The Giving Pledge but made contributions, including $50 million to Stanford hospital and support for AIDS and HIV relief programs in Africa.</p>

            <p>Steve Jobs faced significant health challenges, beginning with his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in October 2003. Initially resisting medical intervention, he opted for alternative treatments, including a vegan diet, acupuncture, and herbal remedies. After a nine-month delay, Jobs underwent a successful pancreaticoduodenectomy in July 2004. Despite not receiving chemotherapy or radiation, his health improved.</p>

            <p>In the following years, concerns about Jobs's health surfaced, with speculations and media reports. In 2009, he underwent a liver transplant due to complications from his previous health issues. During this time, Tim Cook offered a portion of his liver, which Jobs declined. However, Jobs underwent a liver transplantation at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis, Tennessee. Jobs's prognosis was described as "excellent".</p>

            <p>In 2011, Jobs took a medical leave of absence, and in August, he resigned as Apple's CEO, appointing Tim Cook as his successor. Jobs continued to work for Apple until his death on October 5, 2011. He passed away at home in Palo Alto, California, from complications related to a relapse of his pancreatic tumor. A private funeral was held, and Apple, Pixar, and other entities paid tribute to his legacy. Governor Jerry Brown declared "Steve Jobs Day," and a memorial service at Stanford University included notable figures and performances by Bono, Yo-Yo Ma, and Joan Baez. Jobs's burial took place in an unmarked grave at Alta Mesa Memorial Park.</p>
